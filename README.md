# Insights of the project
# Budget
A company goal is to make money from the movie the created. For this to happen they have to have a good budget to work with.
Startup companies tend to go easy on their first movies .

The average movie production cost around 5m to 40m.

            1. Minimum budget = 1100
            2. Maximum budget = 92.5m
            3. Q3 = 40m
            4. Q1 = 5m

Movies above 40m are risky of high losses if the movie doesn't perform well.
Movies below 5m are risky of poor quality due to the low budget production.


# Genre
Knowing the type of movie to create that will generate money is one step to success.
There are many genres of movies out there, but few of them have a large market. 
To understand these genres that have a large market is a key advantage in the movie industry.

These are the top ten genres with large markets.

Action,Adventures, Sci-Fi movies are the very popular among all the genres. However they are not popular. They are either very popular or not popular.
Drama, Comedy, (Comedy,Drama,Romance) movie genres are the most balanced movie genre. They are very popular, popular but still not popular.

This creates a large market for movies.
To create a profitable movie, target the US market since it has high number of customers due to their movie culture.

# Movie runtime
Humans tend to have a short concentration span. 
Having very long movies will lead to boring the audience and have a negative reviews to the movie.
On the other hand having very short movies will lead to poor plot of the movie leading again to bad reviews.
Knowing the estimate time for a proper movie is a key advantage.
